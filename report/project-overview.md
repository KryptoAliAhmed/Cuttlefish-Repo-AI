# CuttleFish Project - Complete Overview

## What is CuttleFish?

CuttleFish is an advanced AI-powered platform that combines document intelligence, voice interaction, and blockchain technology to create a comprehensive digital assistant system. Think of it as a smart, interactive system that can understand your documents, answer questions, and help manage projects through both text and voice interactions.

## üéØ What Does It Do?

### 1. **Smart Document Assistant**
- Upload documents (PDFs, Word docs, presentations, etc.)
- Ask questions about your documents in natural language
- Get intelligent, contextual answers based on your actual content
- The system "learns" from your documents to provide accurate responses

### 2. **Voice-First Interaction**
- Speak to the system naturally using your voice
- Real-time speech-to-text conversion
- Optional text-to-speech responses
- Hands-free operation for busy professionals

### 3. **Project Management & Scoring**
- Track project performance across three key areas:
  - **Financial**: Cost analysis, ROI projections, funding sources
  - **Ecological**: Environmental impact, sustainability metrics
  - **Social**: Community benefits, job creation, regulatory compliance
- Visual dashboards showing project health and progress

### 4. **Interactive 3D Experience**
- Beautiful 3D cuttlefish visualization that responds to user interaction
- State-based animations (idle, curious, thinking, excited, cautious)
- Engaging visual feedback for system status

### 5. **Blockchain Integration** (Future)
- Multi-signature wallet capabilities for secure fund management
- Decentralized governance structures
- Transparent audit trails for all transactions

## üèóÔ∏è How It Works (In Simple Terms)

### The Technology Stack

**Frontend (What Users See):**
- Modern web interface built with Next.js (React framework)
- Beautiful, responsive design that works on all devices
- Real-time voice interaction capabilities
- Interactive 3D visualizations

**Backend (The Brain):**
- FastAPI server (Python-based) that handles all the heavy lifting
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) system that combines document knowledge with AI
- Support for multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini, xAI)
- Document processing and storage

**AI Integration:**

### The Process Flow

1. **Document Upload**: Users upload their documents to the system
2. **Processing**: The system breaks down documents into searchable chunks
3. **Question Asked**: User asks a question (text or voice)
4. **Smart Search**: System finds relevant information from uploaded documents
5. **AI Enhancement**: AI combines document knowledge with its own understanding
6. **Response**: User receives a comprehensive, well-formatted answer
7. **Learning**: System improves over time based on interactions
