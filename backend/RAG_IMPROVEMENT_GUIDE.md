# RAG System Improvement Guide

## Issues Identified in Your Current RAG System

Based on your query about "Nature Stewardship AI Framework" and the response you received, here are the main issues:

### 1. **Low Confidence (34.3%)**
- **Problem**: The system found irrelevant content (NFT staking) instead of the actual topic
- **Cause**: Poor semantic search or insufficient relevant documents
- **Solution**: Improved embedding model and better document chunking

### 2. **"Source: Unknown"**
- **Problem**: The system can't identify which document provided the information
- **Cause**: Missing or corrupted source tracking
- **Solution**: Enhanced source tracking in the improved RAG functions

### 3. **Generic Response**
- **Problem**: The answer was mostly inference rather than direct document content
- **Cause**: Poor prompt engineering and context retrieval
- **Solution**: Better prompts and context filtering

### 4. **No Relevant Context**
- **Problem**: Retrieved NFT staking content instead of Nature Stewardship AI Framework
- **Cause**: Semantic search not finding the right documents
- **Solution**: Better document indexing and search algorithms

## Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced RAG Functions**
- `answer_question_improved()`: Better context retrieval and source tracking
- `_generate_answer_with_improved_context()`: Improved prompts with source citations
- `search_documents()`: Detailed search results with relevance scores
- `get_document_statistics()`: Comprehensive document analysis

### 2. **Better Prompt Engineering**
- Explicit instructions to only answer based on provided context
- Source citation requirements
- Clear instructions to say "no information found" when appropriate
- Lower temperature (0.3) for more consistent responses

### 3. **Improved Context Retrieval**
- Increased search results from 3 to 5 documents
- Better filtering of irrelevant results (distance < 1.0)
- Source information included in context
- Multiple relevant documents combined intelligently

### 4. **Enhanced Source Tracking**
- Source information embedded in context
- Better source identification and citation
- Detailed search results with source attribution

## How to Test the Improvements

### 1. **Run the Diagnostic Tool**
```bash
cd backend
python rag_diagnostic.py
```

### 2. **Test Specific Queries**
```bash
# Test the improved system
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"question": "What is Nature Stewardship AI Framework?", "mode": "default"}'
```

### 3. **Check Document Statistics**
```bash
curl http://localhost:5002/api/document-stats
```

### 4. **Search Documents**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query": "Nature Stewardship AI Framework", "top_k": 5}'
```

## Expected Improvements

### Before (Your Current Response):
- Confidence: 34.3%
- Source: Unknown
- Answer: Generic inference about NFT staking
- Quality: Poor

### After (With Improvements):
- Confidence: Should be >70% if relevant documents exist
- Source: Specific document name
- Answer: Direct information from documents with citations
- Quality: Much better

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Document Quality**
- Ensure you have documents about Nature Stewardship AI Framework
- Check document chunking - chunks should be meaningful
- Verify document loading and indexing

### 2. **Embedding Model**
- Consider using a better embedding model (e.g., OpenAI text-embedding-3-large)
- Fine-tune embeddings for your specific domain

### 3. **Document Processing**
- Improve document chunking strategy
- Add metadata to chunks
- Implement better document preprocessing

### 4. **Monitoring**
- Use the diagnostic tool regularly
- Monitor confidence scores
- Track source attribution accuracy

## Quick Fixes

### 1. **Restart the RAG Service**
```bash
cd backend
python rag_fastapi.py
```

### 2. **Rebuild Index**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5002/api/build-embeddings
```

### 3. **Add Relevant Documents**
- Upload documents about Nature Stewardship AI Framework
- Ensure proper document processing

### 4. **Test with Known Content**
- Try queries about content you know exists in your documents
- Verify the system can find and cite the right sources

## Next Steps

1. **Run the diagnostic tool** to identify specific issues
2. **Test the improved system** with your original query
3. **Add relevant documents** if the topic is missing
4. **Monitor performance** using the new endpoints
5. **Iterate and improve** based on results

The improved RAG system should provide much better results with proper source attribution and higher confidence scores when relevant documents are available.
