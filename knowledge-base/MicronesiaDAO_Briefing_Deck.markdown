## Slide 2: Executive Summary
**Title**: Transforming FSM into a Climate-Resilient Hub  
**Text**:  
- **Vision**: Sovereign, sustainable FSM through DAO-governed infrastructure.  
- **Focus**: Coral atoll elevated land, geothermal + basalt industry, AI compute.  
- **Funding**: $5M co-matched via Green Island Core Vault, diaspora, Blue Prosperity Coalition.  
- **Impact**: 100,000+ m² stormproof land, 2,000+ kW clean energy, 10,000+ DAO participants.

## Slide 3: Challenges Facing FSM
**Title**: Existential Threats to Small Island States  
**Text**:  
- Fresh water insecurity (rising salinity, erratic rainfall).  
- Limited safe land (sea-level rise, atoll overpopulation).  
- Housing shortages + high unemployment.  
- Infrastructure vulnerability (import reliance, isolation).  
**Visual**: Split image of flooding atoll vs. volcanic island potential (geothermal, basalt).
