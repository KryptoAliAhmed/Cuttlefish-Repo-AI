# Leveraging Cuttlefish Labs’ Tools for SIDS Infrastructure DAO

## Objective

Utilize Cuttlefish Labs’ DAO infrastructure (Cuttlefish IntakeBot, BuilderVault.sol) to streamline proposal intake, funding allocation, and stakeholder engagement for SIDS sustainability initiatives, with a focus on MicronesiaDAO and Vanuatu. Promote democratic DAO governance, Web3 capitalism, cryptocurrency, and AI as a US-led investment in island nations to foster climate resilience and economic prosperity.

## 1. Cuttlefish IntakeBot for Proposal Intake

### Overview
The Cuttlefish IntakeBot, a Telegram-based interface, automates the collection, evaluation, and prioritization of infrastructure proposals for SIDS. It engages stakeholders (FSM/Vanuatu residents, diaspora, and global investors) in real-time, ensuring transparency and democratic participation.

### Implementation
- **Adaptation for SIDS**:
  - Deploy a Telegram bot instance for MicronesiaDAO.eth and VanuatuDAO.eth, integrated with Snapshot.org for governance.
  - Customize the bot to handle SIDS-specific proposal categories: geothermal energy, waste-to-energy (W2E), basalt fiber production, marine architecture, and AI data centers.
  - Use multilingual support (e.g., English, Chuukese, Pohnpeian for FSM; Bislama for Vanuatu) to ensure accessibility.
- **Workflow**:
  1. **Proposal Submission**: Stakeholders submit proposals via Telegram, including project details (e.g., W2E hub on Pingelap, geothermal pilot in Pohnpei).
  2. **Automated Scoring**: The bot’s ScoringAgent, powered by AI, evaluates proposals based on ESG criteria (environmental impact, social benefit, governance feasibility) and alignment with SIDS goals (e.g., carbon sequestration, job creation).
  3. **Community Feedback**: Proposals are shared in Telegram channels for stakeholder input, with reputation-weighted voting (using Soulbound Tokens, SBTs) to reflect community trust.
  4. **Snapshot Integration**: Approved proposals are pushed to Snapshot for final DAO voting, ensuring democratic governance.
- **US Investment Angle**:
  - Highlight US-based AI and Web3 expertise (e.g., Cuttlefish Labs’ tech stack) as a cornerstone of the initiative, positioning the US as a partner in SIDS’ digital transformation.
  - Promote partnerships with US firms (e.g., Dyson, as per the MOU) to showcase American innovation in robotics and energy solutions.

### Yield
- Streamlined intake process, reducing administrative overhead by 40%.
- Enhanced community engagement, with 80%+ stakeholder participation via Telegram.
- Transparent, auditable proposal pipeline, fostering trust in DAO governance.

## 2. BuilderVaultFSM.sol for Funding Allocation

### Overview
BuilderVaultFSM.sol is a smart contract designed to manage capital deployment for MicronesiaDAO’s infrastructure projects, using milestone-based releases and tokenized incentives (BLDR, SISD tokens). It can be adapted for VanuatuDAO and other SIDS, ensuring secure, transparent funding aligned with Web3 capitalism principles.

### Smart Contract Design
Below is a simplified Solidity contract outline for BuilderVaultFSM.sol, tailored for MicronesiaDAO but extensible to Vanuatu and other SIDS.
