State AIS Plans have been transmitted by state governors and then approved by the Aquatic Nuisance Species Task Force. All state grants will be awarded based on a competitive process for which only Great Lakes states or their designee are eligible.Funding is provided to support implementation of State AIS Plans which helps states in preventing introduction and spread of AIS on state and surrounding lands. State environmental agencies develop the science-based plans and approaches to make sound decisions to prevent the introduction and spread of AIS and adapt to changes in state waters over time.Proposed work must either be within the Great Lakes Basin or near enough to the basin that it contributes substantially to the prevention and/or control of AIS in the Great Lakes Basin. Activities such as outreach, boat ramp inspections, and/or law enforcement are often done outside the basin but make substantial contributions when work is done in areas where people are likely to transit (and thereby potentially transfer AIS) into the Great Lakes Basin. Early detection, rapid response, and/or control efforts outside the basin must address:•      Species with a substantial potential for interbasin transfer (e.g., hydrilla in a waterbody near the Great Lakes Basin that receives heavy boat use).•      Species of significant concern to the Great Lakes community within a Great Lakes state.•      Activities where the primary motivation is to prevent transfer of AIS into the Great Lakes Basin.In the end, we are pursuing and funding whatever actions have the greatest benefit to the Great Lakes Basin.INVASIVE CARP WORK IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR CONSIDERATION IF IT HAS BEEN INITIALLY SUBMITTED AND VETTED THROUGH THE ANNUAL DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL PROCESS FOR THE INVASIVE CARP REGIONAL COORDINATING COMMITTEE'S (ICRCC) INVASIVE CARP ACTION PLAN.

The ICRCC develops an annual work plan that is largely supported through a separate source of GLRI funding and which undergoes a separate review process that includes Office of Management and Budget (OMB) review and approval."

These achievements lie at the confluence of mathematics, statistics, engineering and computer science, yet a clear explanation of the remarkable power and also the limitations of such AI systems has eluded scientists from all disciplines. Critical foundational gaps remain that, if not properly addressed, will soon limit advances in machine learning, curbing progress in artificial intelligence. It appears increasingly unlikely that these critical gaps can be surmounted with increased computational power and experimentation alone. Deeper mathematical understanding is essential to ensuring that AI can be harnessed to meet the future needs of society and enable broad scientific discovery, while forestalling the unintended consequences of a disruptive technology.


The National Science Foundation Directorates for Mathematical and Physical Sciences (MPS), Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE), Engineering (ENG), and Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences (SBE) will jointly sponsor research collaborations consisting of mathematicians, statisticians, computer scientists, engineers, and social and behavioral scientists focused on the mathematical and theoretical foundations of AI. Research activities should focus on the most challenging mathematical and theoretical questions aimed at understanding the capabilities, limitations, and emerging properties of AI methods as well as the development of novel, and mathematically grounded, design and analysis principles for the current and next generation of AI approaches.

Mathematical reasoning is a central ability of human intelligence that plays an important role in knowledge discovery. In the last decades, both the mathematics and computer science communities have contributed to research in machine-assisted mathematical reasoning, encompassing conjecture, proof, and verification. This has been in the form of both formal methods and interactive theorem provers, as well as using techniques from artificial intelligence. Recent technological advances have led to a surge of interest in machine-assisted mathematical reasoning from the mathematical sciences, formal methods, and AI communities. In turn, advances in this field have potential impact on research in AI."

Contemporary cultural anthropology is an arena in which diverse research traditions and methodologies are valid in investigations of human cultural variation. Recognizing the breadth of the field's contributions to science, the Cultural Anthropology Program welcomes proposals for empirically grounded, fieldwork/lab-based theoretically engaged and methodologically sophisticated research in all sub-fields of cultural anthropology. Because the National Science Foundation's mission is to support basic research, the NSF Cultural Anthropology Program does not fund research that takes as its primary goal improved clinical practice, humanistic understanding or applied policy. A proposal that applies anthropological methods to a social problem but does not propose how that problem provides an opportunity to make a theory-testing and/or theory-expanding contribution to anthropology will be returned without review.


Program research priorities include, but are not limited to, research that increases our understanding of:

<ul>
<li>Sociocultural drivers of critical anthropogenic processes such as deforestation, desertification, land cover change, urbanization and poverty.</li>
<li>Resilience and robustness of sociocultural systems.</li>
<li>Scientific principles underlying conflict, cooperation and altruism, as well as explanations of variation in culture, norms, behaviors and institutions.</li>
<li>Economy, culture, migration and globalization.</li>
<li>Variability and change in kinship and family norms and practices.</li>
<li>General cultural and social principles underlining the drivers of health outcomes and disease transmission.</li>
<li>Biocultural work that considers the nexus of human culture and its relationship with human biology.</li>
<li>Social regulation, governmentality and violence.</li>
<li>Origins of complexity in sociocultural systems.</li>
<li>Language and culture: orality and literacy, sociolinguistics and cognition.</li>
<li>Theoretically-informed approaches to co-production in relation to scientific understandings of human variability and environmental stewardship.</li>
<li>Mathematical and computational models of sociocultural systems such as social network analysis, agent-based models, multi-level models, and modes that integrate agent-based simulations and geographic information systems (GIS).</li>
<li>Socio-cultural drivers of technology and technological systems such as AI, machine learning, augmented data, and platforms.</li>

The Biosensing program supports fundamental engineering research in the monitoring, identification and/or quantification of biological analytes and phenomena using innovations that exist at the intersection of engineering, life sciences, and information technology. Projects submitted to the program must advance both engineering and life sciences.

<p class=""Default"">The Biosensing program encourages proposals that, in addition to advancing biosensing technology, address critical sensor needs in biomedical research, public health, food safety, agriculture, forensics, environmental protection, and homeland security.

<p class=""Default"">Proposals are especially encouraged in areas of critical need: sensing technologies that can enable monitoring and surveillance of the environment and/or individuals for novel infectious agents; platform technologies that can readily be modified as soon as new agents are detected, sequenced, and/or otherwise characterized to enable rapid deployment of sensors in clinics and the environment; and adaptive and/or multiplex sensing technologies that can help the nation prevent the spread of the next global pandemic.


Major areas of interest for the program include:

<ul>
<li style=""text-align: left;"">Novel signal transduction principles and mechanisms that enable sensitive and specific biosensors, suitable for measurements in multiple areas;</li>
<li>Design of novel biorecognition elements and appropriately designed transducing systems to enable adaptable and/or reconfigurable operating parameters in response to environmental changes or application needs at levels of device, system, or data analysis;</li>
<li>Development of adaptive and/or evolvable biosensing systems for detection of novel target analytes or analytes under novel conditions;</li>
<li>Novel synthetic biology approaches for the development of cell-free and cell-based biosensors; and</li>
<li>Combining biosensors with artificial intelligence (AI) methods to improve sensor specificity and response time.</li>
</ul>

Innovative ideas outside of the above specific interest areas may be considered. However, prior to submission, it is recommended that the PI contact the program director to avoid the possibility of the proposal being returned without review.


The Biosensors program does not encourage proposals addressing circuit design for signal processing and amplification, computational modeling, and microfluidics for sample separation and filtration. Medical imaging-based measurements are outside of the scope of the program interests. Proposals that rely heavily on descriptive approaches are given lower priority. Proposals for optimizing and/or utilizing established methods for specific applications should be directed to programs focused on the application of sensor technology.


NOTE: Projects related to water and/or soil quality may be jointly supported with the Environmental Engineering program (CBET 1440). Photonic devices with medical imaging and/or optogenetics should be submitted to the Biophotonics program (CBET 7236). Applications of devices for tissue engineering or organ-on-chip systems should be submitted to the Engineering of Biomedical Systems program (CBET 5345). Basic chemical/biochemical sensing mechanisms should be submitted to the Chemical Measurement and Imaging program (CMI 6880) in the Division of Chemistry. Proposals for dynamic biosensing systems, including circuit design for signal/data processing and amplification, and sensing systems through communication and machine learning should be submitted to the Communications, Circuits, and Sensing-Systems program (CCSS 7564) in the Division of Electrical, Communications, and Cyber Systems.


INFORMATION COMMON TO MOST CBET PROGRAMS


Proposals should address the novelty and/or<a href=""http://www.nsf.gov/about/transformative_research/faq.jsp"">potentially transformative nature</a>of the proposed work compared to previous work in the field.Also, it is important to address why the proposed work is important in terms of engineering science, as well as to also project the potential impact on society and/or industry of success in the research.The novelty or potentially transformative nature of the research should be included, as a minimum, in the Project Summary of each proposal.


The duration of unsolicited proposal awards in CBET is generally up to three years. Single-investigator award budgets typically include support for one graduate student (or equivalent) and up to one month of PI time per year(awards for multiple investigator projects are typically larger). Proposal budgets that are much larger than typical should be discussed with the program director prior to submission. Proposers can view budget amounts and other information from recent awards made by this program via the ?What Has Been Funded (Recent Awards Made Through This Program, with Abstracts)? link towards the bottom of this page.


Faculty Early Career Development(CAREER)program proposals are strongly encouraged.Award duration is five years.The submission deadline for Engineering CAREER proposals is in July every year. Learn more in the <a href=""https://www.nsf.gov/career"">CAREER program description</a>.


Proposals for Conferences, Workshops, and Supplements: PIs are strongly encouraged to discuss their requests with the program director before submission of the proposal.


Grants forRapid Response Research(RAPID)andEArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research(EAGER)are also considered when appropriate. Please note that proposals of these types must be discussed with the program director before submission. Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI)proposals that integrate fundamental research with translational results and are consistent with the application areas of interest to each program are also encouraged. Please note that RAPID, EAGER, and GOALI proposals can be submitted anytime during the year.

<p><br></p>
<p>TACTICAL BEHAVIORS FOR AUTONOMOUS MANEUVER COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH PROGRAM (TBAM-CRP)</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Future Army forces will be called upon to operate and maneuver in multi-domain</p>
<p>operations (MDO), against a modern and capable peer adversary. The battlefield of the future</p>
<p>may impose additional constraints on maneuver forces such as disruption in communication as</p>
<p>well as positioning services. To field a highly capable fighting force in this future battlefield,</p>
<p>novel tactics and doctrines leveraging nascent technologies in robotics and autonomous systems</p>
<p>(RAS) will need to be developed. Teams of RAS will serve an increasingly critical role in the</p>
<p>future force to deliver situational awareness, defend key locations or positions, or take point in</p>
<p>dynamic and hazardous situations. Resilience to disruptions, failures, or unexpected scenarios, is</p>
<p>a key quality for teams of RAS to operate alongside other future Army forces. The US Army</p>
<p>Combat Capabilities Development Command (DEVCOM) Army Research Laboratory (ARL) is</p>
<p>focused on developing fundamental understanding and informing the art-of-the-possible for</p>
<p>warfighter concepts through research to greatly improve the scope of mission capabilities of</p>
<p>teams of RAS, develop robust and resilient approaches to plan under extreme conditions of</p>
<p>uncertainty, to learn coordinated strategies for groups of agents to achieve a common objective,</p>
<p>all within a complex maneuver environment including adversaries. The Tactical Behaviors for</p>
<p>Autonomous Maneuver Collaborative Research Program (TBAM-CRP) is focused on developing</p>
<p>and experimentally evaluating coordinated and individual behaviors for small groups of</p>
<p>autonomous agents to learn doctrinal as well as novel tactics for maneuvering in military relevant</p>
<p>environments. The TBAM-CRP will leverage developments in other internal and extramural</p>
<p>programs as well as identify new research directions to find novel solutions to these maneuver</p>
<p>problems in analogical simulations representing complex realistic terrain.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The Tactical Behaviors for Autonomous Maneuver Collaborative Research Program (TBAM-CRP) will</p>
<p>consist of a series of sprint efforts executed with annual program reviews. Each topic will be focused on</p>
<p>addressing a different set of scientific areas which will support the research aims of an associated ARL</p>
<p>researcher from a related internal essential research program (ERP) or mission-funded program.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>The TBAM-CRP has been developed in coordination with other related ARL-funded collaborative efforts</p>
<p>(see descriptions of ARL collaborative alliances at https://www.arl.army.mil/business/collaborativealliances/)</p>
<p>and shares a common vision of highly collaborative academia-industry-government</p>
<p>partnerships; however, it will be executed with a program model adapted from the Scalable, Adaptive,</p>
<p>and Resilient Autonomy (SARA), which established a new paradigm for collaborative research. Some</p>
<p>key properties of this new approach are described below:</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>• TBAM-CRP sprint topics will be offered on a two-year cycle. Proposals will be solicited for a</p>
<p>possible two-year period structured as a first-year pilot followed by a second-year option where</p>
<p>the option may be awarded based upon progress assessed at an annual review. The FOA will be</p>
<p>amended annually to identify a specific problem statement and scope for that specific cycle. The</p>
<p>topics for each cycle will be chosen to address the long-term program goal.</p>
<p>• Five new topics (Cycles 1-5) are expected in FY22, 24, 26, 28, 30. Each topic will be carefully</p>
<p>chosen based on the previous accomplishments in the prior cycle(s), the development of new</p>
<p>technologies and capabilities in the broader research and development communities, and the</p>
<p>Army’s evolving needs for future capabilities.</p>
<p>• For each topic, funding will be provided to those Recipients selected under a cooperative</p>
<p>agreement (CA).</p>
<p>• Enhanced Research Program funding from ARL or Other Government Agencies (OGAs) may</p>
<p>become available during a cycle which provides a mechanism for growth and enhancement within</p>
<p>the TBAM-CRP. A proposal should not include any discussion of the Enhanced Research</p>
<p>Program. Recipients receiving a CA will be notified and provided details if the opportunity for</p>
<p>Enhanced Research Program funding becomes available during their award period of</p>
<p>performance.</p>
<p>• There is no limitation on the place of performance, although on-site collaboration at ARL</p>
<p>facilities and with ARL researchers as well as with other Recipients are encouraged. Research</p>
<p>outcomes in this program must, at the very least, be demonstrated in sophisticated simulations of</p>
<p>relevant environments. Together with ARL collaborators, these results may be adapted for higher</p>
<p>TRL experimentation on surrogate platforms at ARL test facilities such as the Robotics Research</p>
<p>Collaboration Campus (R2C2) at Graces Quarters, Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland.</p>
<p>• Recipients will be furnished with access to the ARL Autonomy Stack software suite as well as all</p>
<p>relevant simulation tools and multi-agent learning support.</p>
<p>• Recipients will be provided with information about the current state of the Autonomous Systems</p>
<p>Enterprise (ASE) with an overview of developments in the associated collaborative research</p>
<p>alliances including Distributed and Collaborative Intelligent Systems and Technology (DCIST),</p>
<p>Scalable, Adaptive, and Resilient Autonomy (SARA), as well as internal ARL essential research</p>
<p>programs including the AI for Maneuver and Mobility (AIMM), Emerging Overmatch</p>
<p>Technologies (EOT), and Versatile Tactical Power and Propulsion (VICTOR). Capabilities</p>
<p>demonstrated in simulation should reflect significant appropriate developments. This midpoint</p>
<p>review is expected to take place as a mini symposium where Recipients can share results with</p>
<p>one another along with the ARL community to foster further collaboration.</p>
<p>• At the end of the second year, a capstone demonstration will be executed by those Recipients</p>
<p>receiving an option to their award in a set of simulated relevant environments, either those</p>
<p>environment scenarios provided by the Government and other program performers, or optionally</p>
<p>of a specific environment developed by the Recipient to exhibit their developed capability. Any</p>
<p>system level capability demonstration that can be made with the internal ARL collaborator or</p>
<p>description of capability development and program contribution can also be made at this time.</p>
<p>These system demonstrations are expected to coincide to foster further integration and adoption</p>
<p>with related internal research programs as well as partner organizations from within the</p>
<p>DEVCOM, other Army and DoD service branches and agencies, in addition to other government</p>
<p>agencies.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Proposals that follow the requirements of the FOA will be evaluated in accordance with merit-based,</p>
<p>competitive procedures. These procedures will include evaluation factors and an adjectival and color</p>
<p>rating system. A review team, consisting of a qualified group of Government scientists and managers</p>
<p>will evaluate the compliant proposals and provide the results of that evaluation to the decision-maker for</p>
<p>the Government. Relevant internal research program materials approved for public release and contact</p>
<p>information will be provided to potential proposers during introductory presentations to help facilitate</p>
<p>identification of collaboration between proposers and individual ARL researchers or internal research</p>
<p>programs. Additional connections to ARL programs can be identified during the proposal review process.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Eligible applicants under this FOA include institutions of higher education, nonprofit organizations, and</p>
<p>for-profit organizations (i.e., large and small businesses) for scientific research in the knowledge domains</p>
<p>outlined throughout this Funding Opportunity. Federally Funded Research and Development Centers</p>
<p>(FFRDC) may propose as well, with effort as allowed by their sponsoring agency and in accordance with</p>
<p>their sponsoring agency policy.</p>"
