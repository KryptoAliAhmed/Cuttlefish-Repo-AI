# üß† Cuttlefish Labs: BuilderAgent Swarm Factory

## Overview
The BuilderAgent Swarm Factory is a next-generation smart contract and AI infrastructure system developed by Cuttlefish Labs to power intelligent, ethical, and composable on-chain agents. It combines predictive AI, collaborative agent architecture, and DAO-driven incentives to coordinate trading, yield generation, and sustainable infrastructure development on Arbitrum and beyond.

## üß± Key Components

### 1. `SwarmAgentFactory.sol`
A modular factory smart contract that deploys specialized agents and manages their roles, access, and inter-agent coordination.

#### Features:
- Role-based instantiation: `deploySpecializedAgent(role, initParams)`
- Agent registry with mapping of role ‚Üí agent address
- Swarm query interface: `queryAgent(role, inputData) ‚Üí outputData`
- On-chain event logging for agent decisions and forecasts

---

### 2. Specialized Agents
Each agent is a minimal proxy (EIP-1167) or cloned instance with specific logic, able to coordinate via on-chain context or off-chain via ADK/Vibekit.

#### a. `PredictiveAgent`
- Forecasts market conditions using Chainlink Functions / zkML
- Uses time series, sentiment, and oracle feeds to output next-move scores

#### b. `RiskAgent`
- Monitors exposure and volatility thresholds
- Can approve or veto trades from PredictiveAgent based on risk parameters

#### c. `ESGAgent`
- Integrates sustainability scores (carbon impact, RWA emissions)
- Applies ethical filters to trading behavior or staking decisions

#### d. `SentimentAgent`
- Gathers off-chain social data (Twitter, Lens, Farcaster)
- Generates confidence scores on narratives (e.g., token momentum)

#### e. `ResolutionAgent`
- Handles disputes or failed trades using ORA-style verifiable AI
- Outputs audit logs and can pause misbehaving agents

---

### 3. Strategy Generator (Off-Chain via Chainlink Functions)
- Prompts LLM (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini) with: market data + intent
- Generates swap routes, yield opportunities, or hedge scenarios
- Returns JSON for on-chain simulation before execution

---

## üß† AI Integration Stack
| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| Chainlink Functions | Forecast calls, LLM strategy prompts |
| zkML or ORA | Verifiable predictions / model outputs |
| Vibekit | MCP-compliant agent coordination |
| ADK (Google) | Off-chain simulation and evaluation |
| IPFS | Pinning audit trails and trade logic |

## üèóÔ∏è Sprint: Developer Tasks (1 Week, 2 Devs @ 20 hrs Each)

### Day 1‚Äì2
- [ ] Scaffold `SwarmAgentFactory.sol` with role instantiation
- [ ] Clone and adapt `PredictiveAgent.sol`
- [ ] Setup Chainlink Functions stub (testnet)

### Day 3‚Äì4
- [ ] Build `queryAgent()` logic
- [ ] Create `generateStrategy()` via external API call (mock)
- [ ] Integrate Forecast validation in `triggerTrade()`

### Day 5
- [ ] Deploy to Arbitrum Goerli
- [ ] Test agent handshakes and decision flows (Predictive ‚Üí Risk ‚Üí Vault)
- [ ] Telegram webhook test with proposal claim

### Deliverables:
- Arbitrum testnet contracts verified on Arbiscan
- GitHub repo push
- Telegram + Vibekit test agents running
- One end-to-end trade from signal ‚Üí swarm ‚Üí vote ‚Üí execution

## üîÆ Future Extensions
- ERC-1155 soulbound agent IDs
- SwarmDAO governance on quest performance
- AI alignment scoring (agent behavior audits)
- Token-weighted upgrades and quest bounties
