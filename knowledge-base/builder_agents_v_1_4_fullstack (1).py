# 🚀 Populating all segments now
# This will include:
# - CoordinationContract web3 client
# - multi-chain AgentMessageBus + Redis integration
# - IntelligentBuilderAgent class with Grok + multi-chain carbon constraints
# - Redis + FastAPI server with /ws_events streaming Solidity CoordinationContract logs
# - Main orchestration to run agents + API together

# Generating full stack code — please hold.

# 🐙 I will write each section progressively inside this textdoc to ensure atomic commits.
# Beginning with CoordinationContract client and all Web3 bindings.
