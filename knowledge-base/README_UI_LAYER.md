# Cuttlefish Widget UI Layer â€“ v0.1

## Overview

The Cuttlefish Widget UI Layer is a modular, multimodal interface system for interacting with the Cuttlefish Collective agents, DAO systems, and regenerative infrastructure blueprints.

It bridges the gap between high-performance AI and inclusive, real-world usabilityâ€”designed for everyone from coders to community leaders to low-literacy users.
